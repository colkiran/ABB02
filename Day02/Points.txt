Marshalling and Data Persistence
--------------------------------
What is marshalling?
Marshalling is a process of converting an objects memory representation into a data format suitable for storage or transmission often between parts of a program or different programs


Marshalling in python refers to the process of serializing python objects into a byte stream, which can then be stored or transmitted. 

Marshal module in python is specifically designed for this purpose, primarily to support the reading and writing of compiled python modules(.pyc files). its a low level serialization approach on converting internal python objects into binary format. The reverse process converting the byte stream back into a Python object is called unmarshalling
